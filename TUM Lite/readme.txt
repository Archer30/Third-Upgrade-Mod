1. Now you can upgrade a dwelling for second time!
We've gotten rid of the special building to take the next step in making the definitive Third Upgrade mod.
The new feature implemented is that now all dwellings in Forts can be upgraded a second time. Features of this version:
*Customizable dwelling via UN:T.
*IA can build the occasional building a second time, but it is still in development to be perfected. (Beta development).
*New names for dwellings to differentiate from the default upgraded version.


2. Creature Upgrades:

*The mechanics are still the same as before, only now you can choose which dwelling to upgrade and creatures to have. AI can also recruit creatures from dwellings that have been upgraded a second time, but this feature is still in the process of being improved.

3. Creature Specialization

    Heroes who specialize in creatures have the following scaling:

    Attack/Defense: +1 Att/Def for every 7 hero levels
    Damage: HeroLvl:Value(based on creature level)
    Health: 9%+1*HeroLvL 
    
    This bonus is added to the creatures only in combat! The normal Heroes3 mechanic (+1 Speed and +Att/Def after each x-level) still works and can be seen directly on your creature in the hero screen.
    You will find this scaling much fairer then the busted WoG script, where each creature ended with +50 Att/Def after enough hero levels. 
    If you are no fan of this script you can just delete the "Creature Specialisation Third Upgrade Mod" and "81 wog - disable options" erm file in the Data/s folder. 

4. Necromancy

Thanks to amethyst, something that has been asked for so much is now possible and it is necromancy compatibility with Third Upgrades Mod.
Necromancy has now been adapted and works as follows:

Basic Necromancy: Raise Skeletons
Advanced Necromancy: Raise Skeleton Warriors
Expert Necromancy: Raise Skeleton Knights

Cloak of the Undead King has also been made compatible with Third Upgrades Mod and Necromancy:

Basic Necromancy: Raise Ghouls
Advanced necromancy: Raise Ghosts
Necromancy Expert: Raise King Liches
