- Fixed Difficulty Mod / Creature Banks not working if wog option "Neutral Town and Creature Growth" is disabled
- Fixed Hero Creature Specialist bonus not given to upgraded and TUM Upgraded creatures


KNOWN ISSUES
- Crash on Left click on Pikemen small portrait
  - Probably related to the above: Refugee camps sometimes shows Pikemen portraits, Peasants name. I have savegame. If you load it and hit Space on Refugee camp, it crashes. When happened first time it shows Pikemen with Peasants name.

- TUM Build Dependency not implemented: e.g.: Orc TUM Upgrade could be built without Freelancer’s guild.
 
- Universal Creature Upgrades wog option -> script will not allow Universal TUM Upgrades.

- Sometimes you can build without having enough resources. If you do that, you will have a negative amount, which will causes many errors.
You know when you can buy with not enough resource because of this:

Scenario:
Not enough resources for build X building

-> Building name background is red AND there is a icon showing barred coins in the lower right of the building image
In this scenario you cannot build

But sometimes this is shown: 
-> Building name background is red BUT there is no icon showing barred coins
In this case you can build with not enough resources 
I think it's related to the fact that Diozia changed most of standard building costs
