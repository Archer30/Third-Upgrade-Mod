KNOWN ISSUES

********************CHANGELOG TUM LITE 2.1*****************

BUGFIX:
- Fixed "Building twice a turn" wog option for TUM Upgrades.
- Fixed Flesheater for Ghoul, now triggers only one time instead of two.
- Fixed creature icons on the left in towns not properly showing sometimes.
- Fixed creature icons on the left in towns now correctly shows TUM Upgrade portraits when built.
- Fixed clicking on creature icons on the left in towns sometimes didn't work.
- Fixed horrible bug which caused sometimes an AI stack to trasform into another owned stack (like 20 marksmen becoming 20 Supreme Archangel)

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Tweaks to AI Building Priority: 

     Fixed AI often not building Citadel/Castle until month 2, by introducing these rules:
  
     Only applies on day_of_week >=6
       if AI has dwelling level 5 or 6 or 7 and can build Citadel, he must build it
       if AI has dwelling level 6 or 7 and can build Castle, he must build it

- TUM Upgrades priority adjustment: Standard TUM Building priority was 30000 (very high), now it is decreased of 10000 for each dwelling 5-6-7 level AI doesn't have
