IMPROVEMENTS
- Tweaks to AI Building Priority: 

     Fixed AI often not building Citadel/Castle until month 2, by introducing these rules:
  
     Only applies on day_of_week >=6
       if AI has dwelling level 5 or 6 or 7 and can build Citadel, he must build it
       if AI has dwelling level 6 or 7 and can build Castle, he must build it

- TUM Upgrades priority adjustment: Standard TUM Building priority was 30000 (very high), now it is decreased of 10000 for each dwelling 5-6-7 level AI doesn't have
