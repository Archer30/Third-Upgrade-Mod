1. New buliding details

Now every town can have a new building that is used as a general 'upgrade guild'. Thanks to this the player will be able to upgrade creatures in the town to their new forms. 
Each town type has a different builiding, a different description, a different animation and a different cost. 
To try to build the new building RIGHT-click on your Town Hall (or Village Hall, City Hall, or Capitol). 
You have always olny one prerequisite to build - you must have a Castle. And of course, you have to have the right resources:

for the Heavenly Tower (Castle) you need:        22000 gold, 30 gems and 30 ore
for the Order of The Sun (Rampart) you need:     20000 gold, 25 crystal and 40 wood
for the Cloud Castle (Tower) you need:           25000 gold, 30 gems and 15 mercury
for the Kreegans' Gate (Inferno) you need:       19000 gold, 30 mercury and 15 sulfur
for the Hall of The Pit (Necropolis) you need:   21000 gold, 25 mercury and 35 wood
for the Underworld Entrance (Dungeon) you need:  23000 gold, 30 sulfur and 35 ore
for the Barbarian Citadel (Stronghold) you need: 19000 gold, 60 ore and 15 crystal
for the Temple of The Snake (Fortress) you need: 18000 gold, 50 wood and 20 sulfur
for the Escaton's Crystal (Conflux) you need:    20000 gold, 30 crystal and 15 gems

	Note, that the right-clicking on the town hall doesn't disable the town destroying feature. However, when it is not needed, the standard text will not be shown. 
	It will 'return' if you build a capitol or destroy the fort - then you'll see the standard text after you click on the 'OK' button. If you completely destroy a town, the new structure will be destroyed as well.

2. Creature Upgrades

	The creature upgrades become available in the town after building the new special structure there *and* having the right upgraded dwellings built. 
	Just click on the creature and you should notice the upgrade arrows. Of course, like with any upgrades, this costs some gold (or even resources). 
	Note, that in the Hill Fort every  new upgrade is also available and all new upgrades are aligned with their towns.
                     NEW: Now you can recruit the creatures in their respective dwellings once the new structure has been bought.

3. Creature Specialization

    Heroes who specialize in creatures have the following scaling:

    Attack/Defense: +1 Att/Def for every 7 hero levels
    Damage: HeroLvl:Value(based on creature level)
    Health: 9%+1*HeroLvL 
    
    This bonus is added to the creatures only in combat! The normal Heroes3 mechanic (+1 Speed and +Att/Def after each x-level) still works and can be seen directly on your creature in the hero screen.
    You will find this scaling much fairer then the busted WoG script, where each creature ended with +50 Att/Def after enough hero levels. 
    If you are no fan of this script you can just delete the "Creature Specialisation Third Upgrade Mod" and "81 wog - disable options" erm file in the Data/s folder. 

4. Necromancy

Necromancy has now been adapted and works as follows:

Basic 10% -Expert 30% Necromancy 
- always raises skeletons
- if Skeleton Warriors are present in the army it will raise them instead of normal skeletons
- if Skeleton Knights are present in the army it will raise them instead of Skeleton Warriors

If the hero wears Cloak of the Unbalanced King
with Basic Necromancy raises Ghouls immediately 
with Advanced Necromancy raises Spectres immediately 
with Expert Necromancy raises Lich King immediately 

5. Additional Units

Now it is possible to obtain additional units in the game, to obtain it there are 2 requirements, 
You are required to build a dwelling of the same level as the same creature (For example to build Treehouse you need to build Enchaing Spring) and build an exclusive building for each faction.
To obtain the upgraded version of the additional unit it is required that the building to obtain a third upgrade be built.
