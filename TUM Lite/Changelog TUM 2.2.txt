- Fixed Difficulty Mod option "Creature Banks" not working if wog option "Neutral Town and Creature Growth" is disabled
- Fixed Hero Creature Specialist bonus not given to upgraded and TUM Upgraded creatures
- Fixed crash on left click on Pikemen small portrait 
- Fixed Refugee Camps offering creatures while showing Pikemen image and crash afterwards 
- Fixed horrible bug which under certain circumstances allowed AI to build both upgraded and TUM upgraded creatures while leaving the number of hiring creatures in town untouched 

KNOWN ISSUES

- TUM Build Dependency not implemented: e.g.: Orc TUM Upgrade could be built without Freelancer’s guild.
 
- Universal Creature Upgrades wog option -> script will not allow Universal TUM Upgrades.

- Sometimes you can build without having enough resources. If you do that, you will have a negative amount, which will causes many errors.
         You know when you can buy with not enough resource because of this:

         Scenario:
         Not enough resources for build X building

         -> Building name background is red AND there is a icon showing barred coins in the lower right of the building image
         In this scenario you cannot build

         But sometimes this is shown: 
         -> Building name background is red BUT there is no icon showing barred coins
         In this case you can build with not enough resources 
         I think it's related to the fact that Diozia changed most of standard building costs
